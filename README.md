I am a visiting scientist at [the Department of Environmental Science, Policy & Management](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/) at [the University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). My research focuses on an understanding of coupled human-environmental systems. I am interested in the use of remote sensing and geoinformation methods in environmental change studies. I connect advance remote sensing methods from big data mining to machine learning with land system analysis. My current study regions are mountains and polar regions. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research.
