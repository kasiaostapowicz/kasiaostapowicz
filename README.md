I am currently a researcher at [the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/Home) with a background in geography and physics. My work focuses on remote sensing, geoinformatics, AI and machine learning, land system science, and landscape ecology. I specialize in studying mountainous and polar regions, examining land use change, climate change, and vegetation change. My research emphasizes sustainable development and nature-based solutions, integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly climate action (SDG 13), life on land (SDG 15), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). As a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research, I strive to advance scientific knowledge and promote sustainable environmental practices. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists in these critical fields.
